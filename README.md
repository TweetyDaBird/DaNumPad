## Notice!!! 
#### DaNumPad is currently under active development! Clone/Build at your own peril! Update will follow when the design has been fully build-tested!

# DaNumPad
A 'family' of mechanical numpad/macro pads that can be configured either as a classic 17-key numpad, or as a 20 key (5x4) macro pad.

- USB-C connector
- Cherry MX compatible switches
- Kailh Hotswap sockets
- Supports PCB-mounted Cherry style stabilizers
- Designed as a companion to most 60% keyboards, being the same 5 row 'height'.
- Sandwich case with top and bottom plate from FR4 material.
- Full SMD design, adapted to easily allow both SMT manufacturing and handsoldering.

## DaNumPad unWired & DaNumPad Glow
Available as two variations, wired and wireless with identical footprint, using the same plate but different PCB.

#### DaNumPad 17 Glow
- Classic 17-Key Numpad layout
- Atmega32u4 MCU
- Full Per-Key RGB
- QMK compatible

#### DaNumPad 20 Glow
- 20-Key macropad with two optional spots for rotary encoders.
- Atmega32u4 MCU
- Full Per-Key RGB
- QMK compatible

#### DaNumPad unWired
- 20-Key macropad with two optional spots for rotary encoders.
- Optional 17-Key layout on the same PCB (Requires soldering hotswap sockets on alternate placing)
- Wireless using an nRF85420 MCU
- ZMK compatible (Bluetooth)
- Can use a QMK compatible, 2.4Ghz Wireless dongle for lower latency/battery consumption. (Under development!)
